title:  "First solver in the Museum: GRASP"
categories: cdcl

Joao Marques Silva provided to the museum the source code of the original GRASP back in 1996.

It is available in [a specific git repository](https://github.com/satmuseum/grasp).

GRASP is important in the history of SAT because it is considered as the root of the Conflict Driven Clause Learning architecture: the authors of GRASP [received the 2009 CAV Award](http://logos.ucd.ie/~jpms/docs/cav-award-fmsd10.pdf) to recognise that major contribution to the current efficiency of SAT solvers.

The solver was presented in the papers:

+ João P. Marques Silva, Karem A. Sakallah: [GRASP: A Search Algorithm for Propositional Satisfiability](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/262032/1/jpms-tcomp99.pdf). IEEE Trans. Computers 48(5): 506-521 (1999)
+ João P. Marques Silva, Karem A. Sakallah: GRASP - a new search algorithm for satisfiability. ICCAD 1996: 220-227
+ João P. Marques Silva, Karem A. Sakallah: [Conflict Analysis in Search Algorithms for Satisfiability](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265008/1/jpms%2Dictai96.pdf). ICTAI 1996: 467-469

Joao Marques Silva developed the main ideas behind GRASP during his PhD titled [Search Algorithms for Satisfiability Problems in Combinational Switching Circuits](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265010/1/jpms-phd95.pdf), defended at the University of Michigan, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department in 1995.

The solver is coded in C++ with a neat object oriented design. The main function `solve`, abstracted in all CDCL presentations, can be [found in the GRASP_SAT class](https://github.com/satmuseum/grasp/blob/master/src/libs/grasp/grp_SAT.cc#L153). Such class delegates to three different classes, [BRE](https://github.com/satmuseum/grasp/blob/master/src/libs/grasp/grp_BRE.hh) for Backward Reasoning Engine, [DecisionEngine](https://github.com/satmuseum/grasp/blob/master/src/libs/grasp/grp_Decide.hh) for the decision heuristics and [FRE](https://github.com/satmuseum/grasp/blob/master/src/libs/grasp/grp_FRE.hh) for Forward Reasoning Engine (aka Boolean Constraint Propagation).
